I  graduated in 2016 with a PhD from Princeton in the Department of [Ecology & Evolutionary Biology](http://www.princeton.edu/eeb/). My advisor was [Simon Levin](http://www.princeton.edu/~slevin/). 

I like to work on applied problems (e.g. problems due to predators, livestock, fishing, and agricultural practices) by understanding the theoretical ecological, and sometimes economic, principles which underlie and perpetuate these issues.

Right now I spend most of my time using large, high dimensional, unstructured data sets to derive novel insights for farmers as a data scientist at [Granular](https://www.granular.ag/).

In my extra time I help my husband with our farm at [Northbourne Farm](http://northbourne.farm) on Vashon Island.
